# CiviMail-Template

This repository is home to three variations of the union's new CiviCRM email template.

## template-simple.html

This template is a simple variation that follows a similar structure to that of the preivously used template.

## template-fun.html

This template is a more complex variation that features additional elements such as a call-to-action button, a content divider, and a list.

## template-web.html

This template is built for modern web browsers, but faces compatibility issues in mail clients. It uses semantic HTML5 elements and a div structure instead of the table structure found in the other templates.
