# IWW Email Templates

This repository is home to different variations of the union's email templates.

## template-simple.html

This CiviMail template is a simple variation that follows a similar structure to that of the previously used template.

## template-fun.html

This CiviMail template is a more complex variation that features additional elements such as a call-to-action button, a content divider, and a list.

## template-web.html

This template is built for modern web browsers, but faces compatibility issues in mail clients. It uses semantic HTML5 elements and a div structure instead of the table structure found in the other templates.

## template-solidarity-tech.html

This template is built for [Solidarity Tech](https://solidarity-tech.org), for use by the North American Regional Administration's Organizing Department.
