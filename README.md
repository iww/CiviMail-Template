# IWW Email Wrappers

This repository is home to different variations of the union's email wrappers.

## wrapper-simple.html

This email wrapper is a simple variation that follows a similar structure to that of the previously used wrapper.

## wrapper-fun.html

This email wrapper is a more complex variation that features additional elements such as a call-to-action button, a content divider, and a list.

## wrapper-web.html

This wrapper is built for modern web browsers, but faces compatibility issues in mail clients. It uses semantic HTML5 elements and a div structure instead of the table structure found in the other wrappers.

## wrapper-solidarity-tech.html

This wrapper is built for [Solidarity Tech](https://solidarity-tech.org), for use by the North American Regional Administration's Organizing Department.
